# Web-Portfolio
A repository of all my different web projects
Some of my projects aren't in a format that I can upload so links can be found below:
- https://www.clarks.co.uk/size-calculator (this code is in the repository but the calculation only works on the live site)
- https://www.clarks.co.uk/Mens/Shoes/c/m103?q=:relevance&sort=relevance - if you select a size and width from the filters and then select a produc those sizes will be pre-selected (this was built into the site's core code) - Produced a 13.5% increase in add to bag and a 5% increase in sales.
- Other tests aren't currently running.
